		Hi World! My name is Jean Bosco NDAYISHIMIYE and this is my first website I create after taking a long journey of studies concerning programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		Who am I? I am a student a Kepler Kigali, a university program that partners with Southern New Hampshire University. I have started to study at this university last year (2017). So far, there are some traits I testify I have that I acquired after attending this school. Here I can list:
		<ul>
			<li>Effective Communication and Marketing</li>
			<li>Creativity and Critical Thinking</li>
			<li>Tech-Savvy Management</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		I love to be on a computer exploring and learning different new subject. Again, I like to spend time praying and reading the Bible. Finally, I like to read inspirational writings.
